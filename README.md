# OmegaVRGlove
Includes a heavily modified version of Onion IoT's fast-gpio library, provides access to RCTiming via c++ code. Writes directly to hw registers, all other functionality has been removed. 

Added functionality to interface with Omega IoT Computer's shift registers to measure and record analog input from bend sensors through digital GPIO pins. 

Implemented statistics logging functionality to keep track of usage and to help debug errors at a hardware level.
